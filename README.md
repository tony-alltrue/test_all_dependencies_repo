# LLM Dependency Classification Testbed

This repository contains a curated collection of real-world dependency files across multiple programming languages. Each file has been carefully designed to test the ability of large language models (LLMs) to dynamically classify dependencies as either:

- üß† **AI/ML-related** (including niche, ambiguous, or research libraries)
- üîß **Non-AI/ML** (general-purpose, misleadingly named, or utility libraries)


## üóÇÔ∏è Contents

Each file contains **20 AI/ML-related** and **20 non-AI/ML-related** dependencies:
